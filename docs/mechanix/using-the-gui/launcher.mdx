# Launcher

This launcher app is built using **MCTK**, our own GUI library in **Rust**. It provides an intuitive interface for interacting with system settings, installed apps, and system monitoring tools.

## Homescreen

The **homescreen** serves as the main interface for the user, displaying essential system information and providing access to different functionalities. The following elements are visible:

- **Clock**: Shows the current time, date and day.
- **Wireless Signal**: Displays the current wireless network status.
- **Bluetooth Status**: Indicates whether Bluetooth is enabled, disabled or connected.
- **Battery Status**: Displays battery percentage and charging status.
- **Device Name**: Shows the name of the device.
- **IP Address**: Displays the device’s current IP address.
- **Network Status**: Indicates whether the device is online or offline.
- **CPU Usage**: Displays the current CPU usage.
- **Memory Usage**: Displays the current memory usage.

Additionally, the homescreen provides:

- **Link to Settings App**: Access the system settings with a quick tap.
- **Pinned Apps**: Users can pin their favorite apps for quick access.

</div>

### Pinned Apps
In the settings.yml file located at `/etc/mechanix/shell/launcher/settings.yml`
the pinned_apps section allows you to specify the app ID / name of the apps you want to display directly on the homescreen. 
These are the apps that will be immediately visible for quick access without opening the app drawer.

#### Example configuration:
   ```yml
   pinned_apps:
   - org.mecha.connect
   - Alacritty
   - chromium
   ```
In this example, the following apps will be pinned to the homescreen:
- org.mecha.connect
- Alacritty
- chromium

Each app is identified by its app ID (a unique identifier) or name. You can modify this list to add or remove apps based on which ones you want to appear on the homescreen.

#### Example for updating pinned apps:

Before updating you will need the app ID or name of the app you want to pin.
You can find app name by opening the app from [app drawer](#app-drawer), once app is opened you can long press home button
to see the app name in the [running apps list](#running-apps). 

To update the list of pinned apps, simply edit the `settings.yml` file located at `/etc/mechanix/shell/launcher/settings.yml` and modify the `pinned_apps` section.

Suppose you want to:
- **Remove** `chromium`
- **Add** `Firefox ESR` and `com.discordapp.Discord`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mechanix/shell/launcher/settings.yml
```

Update the file as follows:

```yml
pinned_apps:
  - org.mecha.connect
  - Alacritty
  - Firefox ESR
  - com.discordapp.Discord
```

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, the homescreen will now show launch icons for:
- `org.mecha.connect`
- `Alacritty`
- `Firefox ESR`
- `com.discordapp.Discord`

##### Note: Ensure you are having mechanix-launcher version >= 0.1.20.

## App Drawer

By sliding up on the homescreen, the **App Drawer** appears, showing a list of all installed apps. Users can manage apps through the following methods:

- **App Installation**: 
  - Install apps via terminal using commands like `sudo apt install`, `snap`, or `flatpak`.
  
- **App Details**: 
  - Long-pressing an app icon brings up the **App Details** screen, where users can:
    - Launch the app.
    - Check system usage.
    - Delete the app if needed.

## Local Setup

To set up the Launcher app locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Rust** installed on your system. Follow the installation guide for your platform at [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mecha-org/mechanix-gui.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the launcher directory:
   ```bash
   cd mechanix-gui/shell/launcher
   ```

3. Copy and Update settings.yml:
   - Before running the Launcher app, you need to set up the settings.yml file in the Launcher directory.
   - The settings.yml file is used for configuring various settings and assets for the Launcher app. You can modify this file to customize the app’s appearance, behavior, and system integrations.
   - Copy the settings.yml.example file to settings.yml in the same directory.

   ```bash
   cp settings.yml.example settings.yml
   ```
   - After copying, open `settings.yml` and update the paths accordingly (such as font paths, icon paths, and other resources).
   
   <br />
   ### Example Path Update:
    If the path in `settings.yml` is:
    ```plaintext
    /usr/share/mechanix/shell/launcher/assets/icons/terminal_icon.png
    ```
    You should change it to something like:
    ```plaintext
    ./src/assets/icons/terminal_icon.png
    ```
   - This is necessary to ensure that the paths are relative to your project's directory structure.

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

5. Build the app:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
