# Launcher

This launcher app is built using **MCTK**, our own GUI library in **Rust**. It provides an intuitive interface for interacting with system settings, installed apps, and system monitoring tools.

## Homescreen

The **homescreen** serves as the main interface for the user, displaying essential system information and providing access to different functionalities. The following elements are visible:

- **Clock**: Shows the current time.
- **Wireless Signal**: Displays the current wireless network status.
- **Bluetooth Status**: Indicates whether Bluetooth is enabled or disabled.
- **Battery Status**: Displays battery percentage and charging status.
- **Device Name**: Shows the name of the device.
- **IP Address**: Displays the device’s current IP address.
- **Network Status**: Indicates whether the device is online or offline.
- **CPU Usage**: Displays the current CPU usage percentage.
- **Memory Usage**: Displays the current memory usage.

Additionally, the homescreen provides:

- **Link to Settings App**: Access the system settings with a quick tap.
- **Pinned Apps**: Users can pin their favorite apps for quick access.

</div>

### Pinned Apps
In the settings.yml file, the pinned_apps section allows you to specify the app IDs of the apps you want to display directly on the homescreen. 
These are the apps that will be immediately visible for quick access without opening the app drawer.

#### Example:
   ```yml
   pinned_apps:
   - org.mecha.connect
   - Alacritty
   - chromium
   ```
In this example, the following apps will be pinned to the homescreen:
- org.mecha.connect
- Alacritty
- chromium

Each app is identified by its app ID, which is a unique identifier for the app. You can modify this list to add or remove apps based on which ones you want to appear on the homescreen.

## App Drawer

By sliding up on the homescreen, the **App Drawer** appears, showing a list of all installed apps. Users can manage apps through the following methods:

- **App Installation**: 
  - Install apps via terminal using commands like `sudo apt install`, `snap`, or `flatpak`.
  
- **App Details**: 
  - Long-pressing an app icon brings up the **App Details** screen, where users can:
    - Launch the app.
    - Check system usage.
    - Delete the app if needed.

The **Status Bar** is visible at the top of the screen when any app is running. It provides essential information and quick access to key functionalities, including:

- **Time**: Current time for easy reference.
- **Wireless Status**: Shows whether Wireless is enabled or disabled.
- **Bluetooth Status**: Shows whether Bluetooth is enabled or disabled.
- **Battery Status**: Displays the remaining battery percentage and charging status.

This status bar provides a constant overview of critical system information while ensuring users can quickly access or interact with key elements of the device without leaving the app they are using.

## Local Setup

To set up the Launcher app locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Rust** installed on your system. Follow the installation guide for your platform at [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mecha-org/mechanix-gui.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the launcher directory:
   ```bash
   cd mechanix-gui/shell/launcher
   ```

3. Copy and Update settings.yml:
   - Before running the Launcher app, you need to set up the settings.yml file in the Launcher directory.
   - The settings.yml file is used for configuring various settings and assets for the Launcher app. You can modify this file to customize the app’s appearance, behavior, and system integrations.
   - Copy the settings.yml.example file to settings.yml in the same directory.

   ```bash
   cp settings.yml.example settings.yml
   ```
   - After copying, open `settings.yml` and update the paths accordingly (such as font paths, icon paths, and other resources).
   
   <br />
   ### Example Path Update:
    If the path in `settings.yml` is:
    ```plaintext
    /usr/share/mechanix/shell/launcher/assets/icons/terminal_icon.png
    ```
    You should change it to something like:
    ```plaintext
    ./src/assets/icons/terminal_icon.png
    ```
   - This is necessary to ensure that the paths are relative to your project's directory structure.

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

5. Build the app:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
