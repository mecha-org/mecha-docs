# Mechanix Shell

The **Mechanix Shell** provides the essential layer shell-based applications of the **Mechanix OS**. These applications are designed to work seamlessly with the system's graphical environment, offering a polished and functional user experience. All applications are developed using our own rust based GUI library, **MCTK**, which ensures high performance, customization, and integration with the Mechanix ecosystem.

## Applications

### Launcher

The **Launcher** is a core component of the Mechanix OS, acting as the home screen and app management hub. It provides the following features:
- Displays essential system information like clock, network status, and battery.
- Offers quick access to pinned apps, settings, and an app drawer for installed applications.
- Supports managing running apps via gestures, such as dragging them up to close.

For more details, refer to the [Launcher Documentation](./launcher).

### Keyboard

The **Keyboard** is a virtual on-screen keyboard for the Mechanix OS, designed with usability and accessibility in mind. Key features include:
- A customizable layout to match various language and input preferences.
- Compatibility with touch-based devices and pointer-based input.
- Integration with layer shell, seamless positioning and smooth performance.

## Layer Shell Integration

All applications in the Mechanix Shell, including the Launcher and Keyboard, are built using **Layer Shell**, which allows seamless positioning, rendering, and interaction with the OS's graphical environment. This ensures:
- Applications adapt to different screen configurations and resolutions (under development).
- Consistent user experience across the Mechanix OS.
