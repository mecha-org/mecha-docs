# Keyboard

The **On-Screen Keyboard** app for **Mechanix OS** is a **layer shell**-based application, designed with a focus on usability and accessibility. Developed using **MCTK**, our custom Rust-based GUI library, it intelligently adapts to different input contexts, offering multiple layouts such as **Alpha**, **Number**, **Password**, **Terminal** etc

The keyboard enhances the typing experience with word suggestions in the Normal layout, powered by a ranked dictionary, and it dynamically adjusts the touch area for probable next characters. These features ensure an efficient and tailored typing experience across a variety of use cases.

## Features

### Layouts supported

The keyboard supports multiple predefined layouts tailored for various input scenarios:

| **ID** | **Layout**    | **Description**                                                                            |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | **Normal**    | Default layout for general typing.                                                         |

Each layout adjusts the key arrangements and input handling for its specific purpose, ensuring an optimal user experience.

### Word Suggestions

The **Normal Layout** includes a **word suggestion feature** to enhance typing speed and accuracy. 

- A **dictionary of words with ranks** is used to prioritize word suggestions.  
  Example dictionary snippet:

  | Word | Rank |
  |------|------|
  | you  | 1    |
  | I    | 2    |
  | to   | 3    |
  | the  | 4    |

- **How it works**:
  - As the user types, the keyboard suggests words based on the current input.
  - Words with higher ranks (lower rank number) appear first in the suggestion bar.
  - For instance, typing "y" will suggest "you" as it is ranked highest in the dictionary.

- **Enhanced Text Area**:
  - The size of the keys for possible next characters dynamically increases.
  - For example, if the user types "y," keys for "o" and "u" will expand since they form the word "you."

This feature ensures faster typing and reduces errors by providing relevant suggestions and highlighting the next probable input.


### Input Modes

The keyboard offers versatile input modes to meet various device requirements:

- **Touch Input**: Optimized for touchscreens.
- **Pointer Input**: Fully functional with a mouse or other pointing devices.

### Protocol Integrations

The keyboard utilizes the following Wayland protocols:

1. **[input-method-unstable-v2](https://wayland.app/protocols/input-method-unstable-v2)**:  
   Handles dynamic activation of the keyboard when a text input field gains focus. It also provides layout switching based on the context of the input field (e.g., password, email, URL).

2. **[virtual-keyboard-unstable-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/virtual-keyboard-unstable-v1)**:  
   Facilitates virtual keyboard input, allowing it to send key events directly to Wayland clients. This enhances the flexibility and responsiveness of the on-screen keyboard.


## Local Setup

To set up the Keyboard locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Rust** installed on your system. Follow the installation guide for your platform at [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mecha-org/mechanix-gui.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the keyboard directory:
   ```bash
   cd mechanix-gui/shell/keyboard
   ```

3. Copy and Update settings.yml:
   - Before running the Keyboard, you need to set up the settings.yml file in the Keyboard directory.
   - The settings.yml file is used for configuring various settings and assets for the Keyboard. You can modify this file to customize the keyboard’s appearance and behavior.
   - Copy the settings.yml.example file to settings.yml in the same directory.

   ```bash
   cp settings.yml.example settings.yml
   ```
   - After copying, open `settings.yml` and update the paths accordingly (such as font paths, icon paths, and other resources).
   
   <br />
   ### Example Path Update:
    If the path in `settings.yml` is:
    ```plaintext
    /usr/share/mechanix/shell/keyboard/assets/icons/key_shift_icon.png
    ```
    You should change it to something like:
    ```plaintext
    ./src/assets/icons/key_shift_icon.png
    ```
   - This is necessary to ensure that the paths are relative to your project's directory structure.

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

5. Build the app:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
## Customizing Layout  

### Overview  
A layout file defines the structure, appearance, and functionality of the On-Screen Keyboard. Each layout is tailored to a specific input type, such as general typing, email addresses, URLs, PINs, or terminal commands.  

With a layout file, you can:  
- **Define Key Placement:** Arrange keys for different contexts (e.g., alphabetic, numeric, symbolic) within the layout.  
- **Set Key Actions:** Configure key behavior, like switching views, entering symbols, or triggering special functions.  
- **Customize Button Styles:** Adjust key sizes, shapes, and icons for an intuitive and accessible interface.  
- **Create Specialized Layouts:** Design unique keyboard layouts for specific tasks, such as email, URL input, or PIN entry.  

Layout files are stored in `src/assets/layouts`, with subdirectories for specialized layouts like `email`, `url`, `pin`, and more.  

### Example

Here's an example of a default alphabetic layout file (`src/assets/layouts/us.yml`):

```yml
