The purpose of this guide is to explain how to use **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**, a package manager for Debian-based distributions, to install, update, and manage software packages.

### 1. Update the package list

Before installing or updating software, update the local package list to ensure you have the latest information:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. Install software packages

To install a software package, use the `apt install` command followed by the package name.

```bash
sudo apt install <package-name>
```

For example, to install the `htop` package:

```bash
sudo apt install htop
```

### 3. Run applications

#### **Using the GUI:**

You can run applications using the GUI. After installing package using above command,
it should appear in [app drawer](/mechanix/using-the-gui/launcher#app-drawer). 
You can access the app drawer by sliding up on the homescreen.

#### **Using the Command:**
If you want to run an application from the command line, you can do so by typing the application name in the terminal.

### 4. Remove software packages

To remove a software package, use the `apt remove` command followed by the package name.

```bash
sudo apt remove <package-name>
```

For example, to remove the `htop` package:

```bash
sudo apt remove htop
```

To remove a package along with its configuration files, use the `apt purge` command:

```bash
sudo apt purge <package-name>
```

For example, to purge the `htop` package:

```bash
sudo apt purge htop
```

### 5. Upgrade installed packages

To upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions, use the `apt upgrade` command:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

### 6. Search for software packages

You can search for software packages using the `apt search` command followed by a keyword.

```bash
apt search <package-name>
```

For example, to search for packages related to Python:

```bash
apt search python
```

### 7. List installed packages

To list all installed packages on your system, use the `apt list --installed` command:

```bash
apt list --installed
```

### 8. Clean up package cache

To free up disk space by removing downloaded package files that are no longer needed, use the `apt clean` command:

```bash
sudo apt clean
```

### 9. Autoremove unused packages

To remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages but are no longer needed, use the `apt autoremove` command:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

### 10. Check package dependencies

To check the dependencies of a package before installing it, use the `apt depends` command followed by the package name.

```bash
apt depends <package-name>
```

For example, to check the dependencies of the `htop` package:

```bash
apt depends htop
```

### 11. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using APT, Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **Package not found**: If you get an error saying the package is not found, make sure you have the correct package name and that the package is available in the repositories.
- **Dependency issues**: If you encounter dependency issues, try running `sudo apt install -f` to fix broken dependencies.
- **Connection issues**: If you have connection issues, check your internet connection and try running `sudo apt update` to refresh the package list.

If you still encounter any issues while using APT, you can refer to the [APT documentation](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/apt.8.en.html).
