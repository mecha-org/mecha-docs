The purpose of this guide is to explain how to use **Snap**, a package manager for installing, updating, and managing software packages in a secure and sandboxed environment on Linux distributions.

## Prerequisites

- You need `sudo` privileges to install or remove software using Snap.
- A working internet connection is required to download and update packages.
- Ensure that Snap is installed on your system. If not, refer to [Snapâ€™s installation guide](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) for your Linux distribution.

<br />

### 1. Install Snap (if not already installed)

If Snap is not already installed on your system, use the following command based on your Linux distribution.

#### **For Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```

#### **For Fedora distributions:**

```bash
sudo dnf install snapd
```

#### **For Arch-based distributions:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S snapd
```

Once installed, the systemd unit that manages the main snap communication socket needs to be enabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
```

<br />

### 2. Test the Snap installation

To verify that Snap is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
snap version
```

The output should display the Snap version information.

<br />

### 3. Install software packages

To install a software package using Snap, use the `snap install` command followed by the package name.

```bash
sudo snap install <package-name>
```

For example, to install the `htop` package:

```bash
sudo snap install htop
```

### 4. Remove software packages

To remove a software package installed via Snap, use the `snap remove` command followed by the package name.

```bash
sudo snap remove <package-name>
```

For example, to remove the `htop` package:

```bash
sudo snap remove htop
```

### 5. Update installed packages

To update all installed Snap packages to their latest versions, use the `snap refresh` command:

```bash
sudo snap refresh
```

### 6. Search for software packages

You can search for software packages available on the Snap Store using the following command:

```bash
snap find <package-name>
```

For example, to search for the VLC media player, run:

```bash
snap find VLC
```

### 7. Run applications

To run an application installed via Snap, use the following command:

```bash
snap run <application-name>
```

For example, to run the VLC media player, run:

```bash
snap run VLC
```

### 8. Update applications

To update an application installed via Snap, use the following command:

```bash
sudo snap refresh <application-name>
```

For example, to update the VLC media player, run:

```bash

sudo snap refresh VLC
```

### 9. List installed Snap packages

To list all installed Snap packages, use the following command:

```bash
snap list
```
