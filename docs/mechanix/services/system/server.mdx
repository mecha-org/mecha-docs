# Mechanix System D-Bus Server

## Overview
The Mechanix System D-Bus server is a background service that provides D-Bus interfaces for managing various system services such as Bluetooth, hardware buttons, and display control. Built in Rust, it enables event-driven communication between Mechanix OS components and underlying hardware.

---

## Interfaces
The Mechanix System D-Bus server exposes several interfaces for managing system services. These interfaces are used by client applications to interact with the server and control system features. These methods can be accessed using the `busctl` command-line tool or through D-Bus libraries in various programming languages. Proxies for these interfaces are available in the Mechanix System D-Bus Client library built in Rust. Proxy methods are then called in the launcher, settings app, and other components to interact with the server.

    ##### Returns:  
    - `1` (enabled)  
    - `0` (disabled)  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

---

7. #### **GetBluetoothProperties**

    ##### Description:
    This method is used to retrieve Bluetooth adapter details.

    ##### Command:
    ```bash
    busctl --system call org.mechanix.services.Bluetooth /org/mechanix/services/Bluetooth org.mechanix.services.Bluetooth GetBluetoothProperties
    ```

    ##### Returns:  
    - Name, MAC address, power state  
    - Discoverability status  
    - Supported features  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

---

8. #### **IsConnected**

    ##### Description:
    This method is used to check the Bluetooth connection status (connected or disconnected).

    ##### Command:
    ```bash

    ```

    ##### Returns:  
    - `1` (connected)  
    - `0` (disconnected)  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

---

#### Signals
The Bluetooth interface also provides a stream to which clients can subscribe to get notifications about Bluetooth events.

1. #### **Notification**
    - **Description**: This signal is emitted when a Bluetooth event occurs (e.g., device connected, disconnected, enabled, disabled).

---

### 2. Hardware Buttons `org.mechanix.services.HwButton`
#### Signals
1. #### **Notification**
    - **Description**: This signal provides a stream to which clients can subscribe to get events when the Power or Home button is pressed or released.

#### Events
- **Pressed**: Button pressed down.
- **Released**: Button released.
- **Pressing**: Button held (long-press).

#### Notification Paths
Clients can subscribe to the following paths to receive button events:
- **Power Button**:  
  `/org/mechanix/services/HwButton/Power`
