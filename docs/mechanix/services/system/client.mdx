# **Mechanix System D-Bus Client**

The `mechanix_system_dbus_client` is a Rust library that provides an easy-to-use client interface for interacting with the Mechanix OS System D-Bus server. It simplifies communication with system services like Bluetooth, Display, and Hardware Buttons using the `zbus` rust crate.

---

## **Overview**

This library contains the following components:

1. **Proxies for Mechanix System D-Bus services**:
   - Provides Rust abstractions for D-Bus methods, signals, and interfaces.
   - Includes functionality for the `Bluetooth`, `Display`, and `Hardware Buttons` services.

2. **Service modules**:
   - Each service module exposes user-friendly APIs that wrap the underlying D-Bus proxies.

3. **Modules**:
   - **`Bluetooth`**: Bluetooth-related operations.
   - **`Display`**: Display-related operations.
   - **`Hardware Buttons`**: Power and Home button event handling.

## **Proxies and their functions**

### **Bluetooth**
This proxy provides a client API for interacting with the Bluetooth service. It allows you to manage Bluetooth adapters, connections, and notifications.

#### Functions:
1. #### **`is_connected()`**
    This method is used to check the Bluetooth connection status (connected or disconnected).
    ##### Returns: 
    - `1` (connected)  
    - `0` (disconnected)  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

2. #### **`status()`**
    This method is used to check the Bluetooth adapter status.
    ##### Returns: 
    - `1` (enabled)  
    - `0` (disabled)  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

3. #### **`enable_bluetooth()`**
    This method is used to enable the Bluetooth adapter.
    ##### Returns: 
    - On success, nothing is returned.  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

4. #### **`disable_bluetooth()`**
    This method is used to disable the Bluetooth adapter.
    ##### Returns: 
    - On success, nothing is returned.  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

5. #### **`get_notification_stream()`**
    This method is used to subscribe to a Bluetooth notifications stream, which emits events like device connected, disconnected, enabled, or disabled.
    ##### Returns: 
    - A stream of Bluetooth notification events.

### **Display**
This proxy provides a client API for interacting with the Display service. This module provides an API for display-related D-Bus operations.

#### Functions:
1. #### **`set_brightness(value)`**
    This method is used to set the display brightness.
    ##### Parameters:
    - `value`: Brightness level (0-254).
    ##### Returns: 
    - On success, nothing is returned.  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

2. #### **`get_brightness()`**
    This method is used to retrieve the current display brightness.
    ##### Returns: 
    - Current brightness level (0-254).  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

3. #### **`enable_backlight()`**
    This method is used to turn the display backlight on.
    ##### Returns: 
    - On success, nothing is returned.  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

4. #### **`disable_backlight()`**
    This method is used to turn the display backlight off.
    ##### Returns: 
    - On success, nothing is returned.  
    - On failure, an error message is returned.

---

### **Hardware Buttons**
This proxy provides a client API for interacting with Home and Power Buttons event stream returned by hardware button interface of Mechanix System D-Bus server.

#### Functions:
1. #### **`get_notification_stream(path)`**
    This method is used to subscribe to a Home and Power button notification stream.
    ##### Parameters:
    - `path`: Path to the button interface (e.g., `/org/mechanix/services/HwButton/Power` to get event stream of Power Button).
    ##### Returns: 
    - A stream for button events.

## **How to Use**
1. Add `mechanix_system_dbus_client` as a dependency in your Rust project.
2. Use the appropriate module (e.g., `bluetooth`) to perform actions.

**Example**:
```rust
use mechanix_system_dbus_client::bluetooth::BluetoothService;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Enable Bluetooth
    BluetoothService::enable_bluetooth().await?;

    // Get the current Bluetooth status
    let status = BluetoothService::status().await?;
    println!("Bluetooth status: {}", status);

    Ok(())
}
```

**Stream subscribe Example for Power button**:
```rust
use mechanix_system_dbus_client::hardware_buttons::{HwButton, Key, KeyEvent};
use std::time::Instant;
use futures::StreamExt;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Subscribe to the power button event stream
    if let Ok(mut stream) = HwButton::get_notification_stream("/org/mechanix/services/HwButton/Power".to_string()).await {
        let mut pressed_at: Option<Instant> = None;
        const MIN_TIME_LONG_PRESS: u64 = 2; // Long press threshold in seconds

        while let Some(signal) = stream.next().await {
            if let Ok(args) = signal.args() {
                let event = args.event;
                match event {
                    KeyEvent::Pressed(Key::Power) => {
                        // Record the time when the button is pressed
                        pressed_at = Some(Instant::now());
                    }
                    KeyEvent::Released(Key::Power) => {
                        if let Some(press_time) = pressed_at {
                            // Calculate how long the button was pressed
                            let power_button_pressed_for = (Instant::now() - press_time).as_secs();
                            println!("Power button pressed for {:?} seconds", power_button_pressed_for);

                            // Check if it was a long press
                            let is_long_press = power_button_pressed_for >= MIN_TIME_LONG_PRESS;
                            println!("Is long press: {:?}", is_long_press);

                            // Reset the pressed time
                            pressed_at = None;

                            // Handle long press or short press
                            if is_long_press {
                                println!("Long press detected");
                            } else {
                                println!("Short press detected");
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    _ => {}
                }
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
