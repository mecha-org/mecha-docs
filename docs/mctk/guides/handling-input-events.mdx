## User Events in Widgets

All widgets possess member variables for the user events they provide,
following the naming conventions of the DOM in JavaScript. For instance,
`on_click` handles clicks on a button.

These events are easily handled by setting these variables with a callback
function. These events are of type `Box<Fn() -> Box<Message>>`. When the event
occurs, the callback function is invoked, and the returned message is
propagated to the application.


The example below demonstrates a back button that changes the route to Home.
```rust
IconButton::new("back_icon").on_click(Box::new(|| msg!(Message::ChangePage {
  page: crate::gui::Pages::Home
})));
```

## User Events in Components

User input events are handled differently in Components compared to Widgets.
The `Component` trait contains functions for user input, sharing the same names
as widget events. These functions are called when the corresponding events are
received.

```rust
impl Component for BackButton {

  ... 

  fn on_click(&mut self, event: &mut event::Event<event::Click>) {
      event.emit(msg!(Message::ChangePage {
        page: crate::gui::Pages::Home
      }));
  }
}
```
