Components are the building blocks of an mctk application.  There are three
types of components: widgets, root components, and simple components.

## Widget

A widget is a component with rendering capabilities.  Many built-in widgets are
provided with mctk, such as button, text, image, and div.

Refer to the guide on building custom widgets for more information.

## Simple Component

A simple component acts as a parent to a tree of widgets and other components.

```rust
#[derive(Default, Debug)]
struct OurComponent {}

impl Component for OurComponent {}
```

## Root Component

As the name suggests, a root component has no parent. It is the top-level
component rendered in an mctk application.

```rust
#[derive(Default, Debug)]
struct OurComponent {}
struct ComponentParams;

impl Component for OurComponent {}
impl RootComponent<ComponentParams> for OurComponent {}
```

Component parameters are passed when the window is opened. These parameters can
be accessed in the `root` function.

```rust
impl RootComponent<ComponentParams> for App {
    fn root(&mut self, w: &dyn std::any::Any, component_params: &dyn Any) {
        let component_params = component_params.downcast_ref::<ComponentParams>().unwrap();
    }
}
```
