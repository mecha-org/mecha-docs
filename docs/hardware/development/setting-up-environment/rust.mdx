Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes performance, reliability, and productivity. It provides memory safety without garbage collection and supports concurrent programming without data races. Rust is particularly well-suited for developing system tools, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

## Install using rustup

Rustup is the official installer and version management tool for Rust. To install Rust:

```bash
# Download and run the rustup installer script
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Load Rust environment variables into current shell session
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Rust is properly installed:

```
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Hello World Example

Let's create a simple Hello World program to test the installation:

**Create a new directory for your project**

```bash
mkdir hello_rust
cd hello_rust
```

**Create a new Rust file**

```bash
echo 'fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}' > hello.rs
```

**Compile and run the program**

```
rustc hello.rs
./hello
```
## Uninstalling Rust

If you need to remove Rust from your system:
```
rustup self uninstall
```
This command will completely remove Rust and all its components from your system.
