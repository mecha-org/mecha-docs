**All Things Open 2024**

29th October, 2024

Raleigh, North Carolina

At Mecha, we are building open computing hardware backed with extensive open-source software support â€“ our first hardware Mecha Comet is a programmable handheld computer. This talk will explore building on hardware for everyone, starting from hobbyist projects to scaling up real-world applications combined with telemetry, networking and transparent security that merges edge and cloud computing in a unified computing fabric.
