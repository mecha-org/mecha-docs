  ### Mecha - Build Computing in the real world
29th October, 2024

#### Location
**All Things Open 2024**
Raleigh, North Carolina

At Mecha, we are building open computing hardware backed with extensive open-source software support – our first hardware Mecha Comet is a programmable handheld computer. This talk will explore building on hardware for everyone, starting from hobbyist projects to scaling up real-world applications combined with telemetry, networking and transparent security that merges edge and cloud computing in a unified computing fabric.
