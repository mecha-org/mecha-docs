This guide will help you set up `pyenv` on your Mecha Comet. `pyenv` is a powerful tool for managing multiple Python versions and virtual environments.

## What is pyenv?

`pyenv` is a lightweight, flexible tool for managing multiple Python versions. It allows you to:

- Easily switch between Python versions.
- Create and manage isolated Python environments for different projects.
- Avoid conflicts between system Python and custom-installed Python versions.

With `pyenv`, you can test your code across different Python versions or run legacy applications that require older Python versions.

## Installing pyenv

Follow these steps to install `pyenv` on your Mecha Comet device.

### Step 1: Install prerequisites

First, ensure you have the necessary dependencies:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

### Step 2: Install pyenv

Clone the `pyenv` repository to your home directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
```

### Step 3: Configure your shell

Add the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d "$PYENV_ROOT/bin" ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init - bash)"
```

Restart your shell for the changes to take effect:

```bash
$ exec "$SHELL"
```

### Step 4: Verify the installation

To confirm that `pyenv` is installed correctly, run:

```bash
$ pyenv --version
```

You should see the installed version of `pyenv`.

## Using pyenv

Here are some common `pyenv` commands:

- List all available Python versions:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv install --list
  ```

- Install a specific Python version:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv install 3.11.4
  ```

- Set a global Python version:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv global 3.11.4
  ```

- Set a local Python version for a project:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv local 3.10.8
  ```

- View the current Python version:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv version
  ```

- Create a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv virtualenv 3.11.4 myenv
  ```

- Activate a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv activate myenv
  ```

- Deactivate a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  $ pyenv deactivate
  ```

:::tip
To list Python versions known to `pyenv` and shows an asterisk next to the currently active version, run:

```bash
$ pyenv versions
```

With `pyenv`, managing Python versions and virtual environments becomes effortless.
