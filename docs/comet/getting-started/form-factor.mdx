The Mecha Comet's form factor is somewhere between a smartphone and a mini PC. The following guide will give you an overview of all physical components of the device.

### On the Exterior
From the outside, the Comet is like a small computer - you have a touchscreen display in the front, two microphones above it and speaker below the display. On one side you have the power and home buttons and connectors on the other side all elegantly placed together.

### Extensions Area
On the front, right below the screen is our extensions area. Lift up the magnetic lid to expose the 40 IOs pins that lets you connect your extensions. This entire area is magnetic on its edges strengthened by a well-tested magnetic pole-pattern.

Now keep the lid aside and try and replace it with one of your extensions, and see if you can shake it off. Shake it like you mean it!

### Pop in the hood
Unlike today's smartphones the Comet's back cover can be easily removed or put back in. Just place your finger in the bottom slit and lift up slowly to unsnap the cover from the device.

With the back cover removed, you can now gaze into the internals of the Comet. You have an antenna on the top, a heatsink that helps keep the processor and RAM cool and the big block of battery down below. Some of the other components are also shown in the below image.

P.S - Did you spot the Allen Key? By design we use a single size screw head for the entire device, so next time you need to open up the device you have the right tool right inside.
