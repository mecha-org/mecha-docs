The Mecha Comet operates on **Mechanix OS**, a Debian-based Linux distribution tailored for handheld devices. This operating system ensures compatibility with over 60,000 packages available in the Debian repositories, allowing users to install and run a vast array of applications seamlessly.

Central to the user experience is the **Mechanix Shell**, an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) built using Rust. Designed specifically for small-screen devices, the Mechanix Shell supports GPU rendering on Wayland, providing a responsive and efficient user-experience.

**Key Features of the Mechanix Shell:**

- **Build in Rust** for blazing fast performance with very low memory/cpu usage
- **Touch-Friendly Interface:** Optimized for the Comet's 3.4-inch capacitive touch LCD, facilitating intuitive navigation and interaction.
- **Open-Source UI Framework:** The shell is developed using Mecha's own open-source UI framework for Linux applications, enabling developers to create and customize applications that integrate seamlessly with the system's interface.

For developers interested in building or porting applications to the Comet, the open-source nature of the Mechanix Shell and its UI framework provides flexibility and control over the user experience.
