Flashing the Mecha Comet with the latest operating system image is a crucial step to ensure that the device is ready for use. Whether you are setting up your Mecha Comet for the first time or updating it to a newer version, this guide provides you with all the necessary steps to successfully flash the filesystem (rootfs/os) onto the device.

The flashing process involves using the Universal Update Utility (uuu), a tool that communicates with the device over USB, allowing you to load the OS image onto the Mecha Comet. This guide will walk you through the entire process, from preparing your environment to getting your device up and running.

By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional Mecha Comet device running the latest filesystem, ready for your projects and experiments.


### Prerequisites
Before beginning the flashing process, ensure you have the following items in place:

1. **Host Machine**    
    This is the computer that will be used to run the flashing utility and establish communication with the Mecha Comet over USB. Your host machine must meet the following criteria:
    
    - It should be running one of the supported operating systems:
        - **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian, or any other Linux-based OS)
        - **Windows**
        - **macOS**
    
    The host machine will be responsible for running the flashing utility and interacting with the device during the process.
    
2. **USB A to USB A Cable**    
    You’ll need a **USB A to USB A cable** to connect the Mecha Comet to the host machine. This cable facilitates data transfer between the devices during the flashing process. Ensure that the cable is in good working condition and that both ends fit securely in the respective USB ports on the Mecha Comet and the host machine.
