title: Connecting via Serial Console
hide_table_of_contents: false

The Comet-M has an inbuilt Serial Console that can be connected using a UART cable. Note, this also can be a **Hail Mary** solution if SSH or any other form of connectivity fails.

## What you'll need

* USB to UART cable - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Serial-Adapter-Signal-Prolific-Windows/dp/B08BLKBK1K)

## Connecting the USB to UART Cable

* The Debug UART pin mapping for the Comet-M is shown below.

```
$ sudo apt add update
```

* Connect the male header pins of the UART cable to the Debug UART pins on the Comet-M
* Connect the USB end of the cable to your machine.

## Connect to Serial Console on Linux

1. Open the Terminal on your Linux machine.
2. Type `dmesg | grep tty` to list the connected devices. Your UART bridge will appear as something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

```
$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
[  542.711750] usb 1-4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

3. Connect to your device using the screen command, followed by the device path and the baud rate, which is typically `115200`.

```
$ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

4. If everything is done correctly, you should now be connected to the device via the UART cable.

## Connect to Serial Console on MacOS

1. Open the Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type `ls /dev/cu.*` to list the connected devices.

```
$ ls /dev/cu.*
/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX
```

3. Identify the device that represents your UART bridge. It should look something like `/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX`.
4. Connect to the device using the screen command followed by the device path and the baud rate i.e. `115200`.

```
$ screen /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX 115200 
```

5. If everything is done correctly, you should now be connected to the device via the UART cable.

## Connect to Serial Console on Windows

You will need the PuTTY application to connect to Serial Console on Windows. Follow [this tutorial](http://developers.mecha.so/comet/connectivity/using-putty-on-windows) on how to use PuTTY.
