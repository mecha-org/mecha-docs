Sometimes, your Mecha Comet just won't boot. Other times, it boots but behaves strangely-and when SSH access isn't an option, troubleshooting becomes even more challenging.

Fortunately, the Mecha Comet has a built-in Serial Console that you can access using a UART cable. This can be a **Hail Mary** solution when SSH or any other form of connectivity fails.

## What is the UART

Embedded systems often need communication with external devices for data transfer, command exchange, or debugging. One of the most common interfaces for this is the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART). When a board reaches the software or firmware team, the first priority is usually setting up the debug console.

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) supports various serial communication protocols for transmitting and receiving data. In serial communication, data is sent bit by bit over a single wire. For two-way communication, two wires are usedâ€”one for transmission and one for reception.

[Simply Embedded has a great overview of UART](http://www.simplyembedded.org/tutorials/msp430-uart/) if you want to learn more.


### **Option 1: Connect the USB to UART Cable**
You will need a USB-to-UART cable to connect to the Mecha Comet. you can check the link for ref [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/WELLDOER-Interfaces-Debugging-Connection-Development/dp/B0D48928M5)

For Mecha Comet, the UART port is located on the backside. Simply remove the back cover to access it.

### **Option 2: Connect USB-C Cable (Breakout Extension)**

You will need a USB-C cable to connect to the Mecha Comet. you can check the link for ref [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.in/Wayona-Braided-Charger-Charging-Samsung/dp/B081FH7R7D)

## Connect to Serial Console on Linux
<S>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
          Open the Terminal on your Linux machine.
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
          Get list the connected devices. Your UART bridge will appear as something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
          ```bash
          $ sudo dmesg | grep tty
            [90797.684048] usb 5-2: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0
            [95515.675293] cp210x ttyUSB0: cp210x converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0
            [97068.662492] usb 5-1: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0
          ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
          Connect to your device using the **screen** command, followed by the device path and the baud rate, which is typically `115200`.
          ```bash
          $ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
          ```
        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
    <S.Step>
        <S.Details>
          Once you start the Mecha Comet, you should see the boot logs on your linux terminal. It will ask you to the provide your Comet login credentials.


          ```bash
          Welcome Mechanix V1.1 
          comet login: mecha
          Password:
          ```

        </S.Details>
    </S.Step>
</S>
If everything is done correctly, you should now be connected to the device via the UART cable. :tada:
