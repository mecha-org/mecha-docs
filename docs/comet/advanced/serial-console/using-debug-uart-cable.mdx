title: Connecting via Serial Console

Sometimes, your Mecha Comet just won’t boot. Other times, it boots but behaves strangely. Maybe you don’t have an HDMI display, and SSH access isn’t an option. Or perhaps—against all odds—someone accidentally cut your Mecha Comet in half, and you need to figure out what’s going on.

Fortunately, the Mecha Comet has a built-in Serial Console that you can access using a UART cable. This can be a **Hail Mary** solution when SSH or any other form of connectivity fails.

## What is the UART

Embedded systems often need communication with external devices for data transfer, command exchange, or debugging. One of the most common interfaces for this is the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART). When a board reaches the software or firmware team, the first priority is usually setting up the debug console.

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) supports various serial communication protocols for transmitting and receiving data. In serial communication, data is sent bit by bit over a single wire. For two-way communication, two wires are used—one for transmission and one for reception.

[Simply Embedded has a great overview of UART](http://www.simplyembedded.org/tutorials/msp430-uart/) if you want to learn more.

## Connect UART Cable to Mecha Comet

For Mecha Comet, the UART port is located on the backside. Simply remove the back cover to access it.

## Connect to Serial Console on Linux

1. Open the Terminal on your Linux machine.
2. Type `sudo dmesg | grep tty` to list the connected devices. Your UART bridge will appear as something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

```
$ dmesg | grep tty
[    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
[  542.711750] usb 1-4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

3. Connect to your device using the screen command, followed by the device path and the baud rate, which is typically `115200`.

```
$ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

4. If everything is done correctly, you should now be connected to the device via the UART cable.

## Connect to Serial Console on MacOS

1. Open the Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type `ls /dev/cu.*` to list the connected devices.

```
$ ls /dev/cu.*
/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX
```

3. Identify the device that represents your UART bridge. It should look something like `/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX`.
4. Connect to the device using the screen command followed by the device path and the baud rate i.e. `115200`.

```
$ screen /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX 115200 
```

5. If everything is done correctly, you should now be connected to the device via the UART cable.

## Connect to Serial Console on Windows

#### Prerequisites

- A USB-to-UART cable
- PuTTY ([Download from here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html))

### Steps to Connect
1. Install PuTTY
Download and install PuTTY from the link above if you haven’t already.

2. Connect the USB-to-UART Cable
Plug the USB-to-UART cable into your Windows PC.

3. Identify the COM Port

    1. Open Device Manager:
        - Right-click on the This PC icon.
        - Select Manage.
        - Navigate to Device Manager.

    2. Expand the Ports (COM & LPT) section.

    3. Note the COM port number assigned to the USB-to-UART cable (e.g., COM3).

4. Configure and Open PuTTY

    1. Launch PuTTY.

    2. Under Connection Type, select Serial.

    3. In the Serial line field, enter the COM port number (e.g., COM3).

    4. Set the Speed (baud rate) to 115200.

    5. Click Open.

The terminal window will open, establishing a serial console connection.
