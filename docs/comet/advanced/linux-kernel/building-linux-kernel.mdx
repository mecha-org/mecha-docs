This guide provides a step-by-step process for building the Mecha Comet kernel from source. It covers setting up a cross-compilation environment, configuring the kernel, compiling it, and packaging the kernel image, device tree, and modules for installation.

---

## 1. Set Up the Cross-Build Environment

Since the target device uses an ARM64 architecture, we need a cross-compilation toolchain for your host machine.

On an Ubuntu-based system, install the necessary toolchain:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

Then, set up environment variables:

```bash
$ export ARCH=arm64
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
```

These variables ensure that the correct architecture and compiler are used for the build process.

## 2. Clone the Kernel Source Repository

clone the kernel source repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/chiragp-mecha/linux-imx) to your host machine:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/chiragp-mecha/linux-imx
$ cd linux-imx

```

This repository contains the Linux kernel source code with Mecha-Comet-specific configurations and patches.

## 3. Configure the Kernel

On your host machine, copy the default kernel configuration for the Mecha-Comet platform:

```bash
$ cp arch/arm64/configs/mecha_v8_defconfig .config
```

You can modify the configuration using:

```bash
$ make menuconfig
```

This command opens a GUI-based configuration menu. Once the changes are made, save and exit.

## 4. Build the Kernel

Compile the kernel using multiple CPU cores for faster execution:

```bash
$ make -j $(nproc)

```

Once the build completes, the key output files are:

- **Kernel Image**: `arch/arm64/boot/Image`
- **Device Tree Blob (DTB)**: `arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/imx8mm-mecha-comet-m-gen1.dtb`

## 5. Create a Debian Package for the Kernel and Modules

### Using `deb-pkg`

To create a Debian package that includes the kernel image, device tree, and modules, run:

```bash
$ make deb-pkg -j $(nproc)

```

This generates `.deb` packages for easy installation.

## 6. Install the Kernel on the Target Device

### Transfer the Kernel Package

After building the kernel package, transfer the `.deb` files to the Mecha-Comet device using `scp`:

```bash
$ scp ../linux-image-*.deb user@mecha-comet:/tmp/

```

Replace `user@mecha-comet` with the actual username and IP address of your device.

### Install the Kernel Package

On the Mecha-Comet device, install the package using `dpkg`:

```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i /tmp/linux-image-*.deb

```

If any dependency issues arise, resolve them using:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get -f install
```

### Reboot the Device

Once installed, reboot the device to apply the changes:

```bash
$ sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, verify that the new kernel is running:

```bash
$ uname -r
```

This should display the installed kernel version.

## 7. Important Notes

- Ensure the kernel image and modules installed on the target device match the same source revision (`SRC-REV`) to avoid compatibility issues.
- If changes are made to the kernel configuration, rebuild both the kernel and the modules before installation.
- The target device must have enough storage and the required dependencies installed for smooth installation.

This guide serves as a reference for building, configuring, and deploying the Mecha Comet kernel efficiently.

# Building the Kernel Using Mecha-Make

To simplify the kernel build process, we have developed `mecha-make`, a build system using Nu Shell. This tool automates kernel compilation, enabling rapid development with just a few commands.

## Prerequisites

### On the Host Machine

1. Download `mecha-make` from the [Mecha-Make GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mecha-org/mecha-make).
2. Install Nu Shell (built with Rust). If you encounter errors, ensure you have the latest version of Rust installed.
3. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y sudo curl git rsync cpio

```

## Steps to Build the Kernel

### On the Host Machine

1. Clone the Linux kernel source:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/chiragp-mecha/linux-imx
$ cd linux-imx

```

2. Create a build directory:

```bash
$ mkdir -p kernel-build

```

3. Execute the build script using Nu Shell:

```bash
$ nu build.nu mecha-comet-gen1 ../kernel-build
```

4. Once the build completes, check the output files in:

```bash
$ ls -laR kernel-build/deploy
```

## Installing the Kernel on the Target Device

### Transfer the Kernel Package

After building the kernel, transfer the output files to the Mecha-Comet device using `scp`:

```bash
$ scp -r kernel-build/deploy user@mecha-comet:/tmp/
```

Replace `user@mecha-comet` with the actual username and IP address of your device.

### Install the Kernel on the Target Device

Log in to the Mecha-Comet device and install the kernel:

```bash
$ cd /tmp/deploy
$ sudo dpkg -i linux-image-*.deb
```

If any dependency issues arise, resolve them using:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get -f install
```

### Reboot and Verify Installation

Reboot the device to apply the changes:

```bash
$ sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, verify that the new kernel is running:

```bash
$ uname -r
```

This should display the installed kernel version.

This method provides a structured and automated approach to kernel building, separating host and target actions to avoid confusion and streamline the process.

## Conclusion

This guide covered the process of building, packaging, and installing the Mecha-Comet kernel. By following these steps, you can ensure that your device runs a custom-built kernel tailored to its needs.
