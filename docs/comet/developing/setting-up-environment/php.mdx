PHP is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is widely used for creating dynamic web pages, backend APIs, and content management systems.

## Install using apt

To install PHP on systems that use `apt` (such as Ubuntu or Debian), follow these steps:

**Step 1: Update the package list**

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Step 2: Install PHP

```
# Install PHP and common extensions
sudo apt install -y php php-cli php-mbstring php-xml php-curl
```

You can replace or add specific PHP extensions as needed.

**Optional: Install additional PHP packages**

```
# Example of additional PHP modules
sudo apt install -y php-mysql php-gd php-zip
```

## Verify Installation
After installation, verify that PHP is properly installed:

```
php --version
```

## Hello World Example
Let's create a simple Hello World script to test the installation:

**Create a new directory for your project**

```
mkdir hello_php
cd hello_php
```

**Create a new PHP file**

```
echo '<?php echo "Hello, PHP!\n"; ?>' > hello.php
```

**Run the script**

```
php hello.php
```
