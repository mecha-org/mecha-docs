TinyLlama is a lightweight language model that can be run on edge devices. This guide walks you through installing and running TinyLlama using Ollama on your Comet.

## Installing Ollama

Download and install Ollama using the following command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Running Ollama

Start the Ollama service:

```sh
ollama serve
