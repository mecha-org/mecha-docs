TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning. This reference guide provides quick and practical instructions for setting up and using TensorFlow on the Mecha Comet platform.

## Installing TensorFlow on Comet

To install TensorFlow on your Comet device, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure your device is ready with the following:
- Python installed via [pyenv](./working-with-pyenv).
- Virtual environment set up using `pyenv virtualenv`.

### Steps
1. Activate your Python virtual environment:

2. Install TensorFlow via pip:

```bash
$ pip install tensorflow
```

3. Verify the installation:

```bash
$ python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

You should see the installed TensorFlow version printed.

## Common TensorFlow Use Cases

### Running TensorFlow Models
You can use TensorFlow for:

- Training machine learning models on datasets.
- Deploying pre-trained models.
- Performing data preprocessing and feature extraction.

### Example: Loading and Running a Pre-Trained Model

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load a pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')

# Prepare a sample input
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

data = np.random.random((1, 224, 224, 3))
data = preprocess_input(data)

# Run inference
predictions = model(data)
print(decode_predictions(predictions.numpy(), top=3))
```

## Where to Use TensorFlow on Comet

TensorFlow can be effectively used in the following scenarios on Mecha Comet:

- **Model Training:** Utilize Comet's processing power to train models locally.
- **Edge Deployment:** Run inference for TensorFlow models on the device for real-time predictions.
- **Data Experimentation:** Use TensorFlow tools to preprocess and analyze datasets directly on Comet.
