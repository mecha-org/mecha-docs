## Changing Display Brightness Using `/sys/class/backlight`

Managing display brightness on a Linux system can often be done through the `/sys/class/backlight` interface, particularly if you have root access. This guide will show you how to view the current brightness, set a new brightness value, and check the maximum brightness level for your display.

## Understanding `/sys/class/backlight`

The `/sys/class/backlight` directory provides a method to control the brightness of displays. This is particularly useful for laptops or devices where direct hardware controls are accessible via the Linux kernel. To control external displays via DDC/CI, you will need the `ddcci-backlight` kernel driver.

## Viewing and Modifying Brightness

### 1. Find the Current Brightness Value

First, you can view the current brightness value by reading the `brightness` file in the `/sys/class/backlight` directory:

```
cat /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness
```

This command will return the current brightness level of your display.

### 2. Check the Maximum Brightness Value

Before setting a new brightness value, it's important to know the maximum brightness your display supports. You can find this by reading the `max_brightness` file:

```
cat /sys/class/backlight/*/max_brightness
```

This will return the maximum value you can set for the brightness.

### 3. Set a New Brightness Value

To set a new brightness value, you'll need to write to the `brightness` file. The new value should be between `0` and the maximum value obtained in the previous step. Replace `<new_value>` with your desired brightness level:

```
echo <new_value> | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness
```

For example, if you want to set the brightness to `100`, and your device uses `intel_backlight`, you would execute:

```
echo 100 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness
```

**"*"** should be replace by actual display device name that you're working with

## Conclusion

By using the `/sys/class/backlight` directory, you can easily manage your display's brightness on a Linux system with root access. This method is particularly useful for devices with hardware-supported brightness control. Always ensure the brightness value you set is within the allowable range to avoid display issues.
