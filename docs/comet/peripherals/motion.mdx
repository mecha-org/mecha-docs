## Gyroscope Configuration on a Linux System

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to read and configure gyroscope sensor parameters on a Linux-based system. The gyroscope sensor is typically interfaced via the Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem, allowing users to access raw sensor data and adjust various configuration parameters.

### 1. Introduction

The gyroscope sensor on Linux systems is often managed through the IIO subsystem, which provides access to sensor data via the sysfs interface. This document outlines the steps for reading raw angular velocity data from the sensor and configuring key parameters such as sampling frequency and scale.

### 2. Accessing Gyroscope Data

The gyroscope sensor data is accessible through the sysfs interface. The raw angular velocity data for each axis (X, Y, Z) can be read from specific files within the `/sys/bus/iio/devices/` directory.

#### 2.1 Reading Raw Angular Velocity

To read the raw angular velocity values from the gyroscope, use the following commands:

- **X-Axis Angular Velocity**:

```bash
$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1/in_anglvel_x_raw
```

This command reads the raw angular velocity of the X-axis.

- **Y-Axis Angular Velocity**:

```bash
$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1/in_anglvel_y_raw
```

This command reads the raw angular velocity of the Y-axis.

- **Z-Axis Angular Velocity**:

```bash
$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device1/in_anglvel_z_raw
```

This command reads the raw angular velocity of the Z-axis.

#### 2.2 Reading Available Parameters

Some gyroscope parameters, such as sampling frequencies and scale, can have multiple possible values. These values can be read from specific files:

- **Available Sampling Frequencies**:

```bash
$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device2/sampling_frequency_available
```

This command lists the possible sampling frequencies for the gyroscope.

- **Available Scale Values**:

```bash
$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device2/in_anglvel_scale_available
```

This command lists the possible scale values for the gyroscope.

### 3. Configuring Gyroscope Parameters

The gyroscope's parameters, such as sampling frequency and scale, can be configured using the sysfs interface. You can set these parameters by writing the desired values to specific files.

#### 3.1 Setting Sampling Frequency

To set the sampling frequency of the gyroscope, use the following command:

```bash
$ echo <value> > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device2/sampling_frequency
```

Replace `<value>` with one of the available sampling frequencies obtained from the previous section.

#### 3.2 Setting Scale

To set the scale of the gyroscope, use the following command:

```bash
$ echo <value> > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device2/in_anglvel_scale
```

Replace `<value>` with one of the available scale values obtained from the previous section.

### 4. Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the sysfs files. Using `sudo` may be required.
- The device numbers (e.g., `iio:device1`, `iio:device2`) may vary depending on your specific hardware and system configuration. Explore the `/sys/bus/iio/devices/` directory to determine the correct paths.
- Incorrectly configuring the gyroscope can lead to inaccurate sensor readings. Always verify the available options before setting any parameters.

## Conclusion

By following these instructions, you can effectively manage and configure the gyroscope sensor on your Linux-based system. Accessing raw angular velocity data and adjusting parameters such as sampling frequency and scale will allow you to tailor the sensor's performance to your specific application. Always handle configuration changes carefully to ensure accurate and reliable sensor data.
