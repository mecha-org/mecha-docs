Access your Mecha Comet remotely via the VNC protocol using `wayvnc` for wayland.

## Installing Wayvnc

- Run the following command to install wayvnc.
    
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt install wayvnc
    ```
    
- Connect to the device via SSH
    
    ```bash
    $ ssh mecha@mecha-comet.local
    ```
    
- Run the `wayvnc` application listening on your all interfaces on the port 5900
    
    ```bash
    $ export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1
    $ wayvnc 0.0.0.0
    ```
    
    > ⚠️  Binding to the 0.0.0.0 interface exposes VNC on all your network interfaces creating a security risk, better idea is to bind to 127.0.0.1 and using Tunneling via SSH for remote access.
    > 
- That’s it, you now have a VNC server running on the Mecha Comet
