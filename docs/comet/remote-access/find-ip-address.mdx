# Find the IP Address of your Mecha Comet

Most methods of connecting to your Mecha Comet from another machine require you to know the local IP address of your Mecha Comet.

Any device connected to a Local Area Network is assigned an IP address. In order to connect to your Mecha Comet from another machine using SSH or VNC, you need to know the Mecha Comet’s IP address. This is easy if you have a display connected, and there are a number of methods for finding it remotely from another machine on the network.

To find the local IP address of your Mecha Comet, you can use the following method:

## Desktop

Simply look at the home screen of your Mecha Comet, where the IP address is conveniently displayed for easy access.

![This is an alt text.](/img/comet-ui.png "This is a sample image.")

## Command Line

You can also use the `hostname -I` command to find the IP address of your Mecha Comet.

<!-- ![This is an alt text.](/image/sample.webp "This is a sample image.") -->

## Network Manager

You can use the built-in Network Manager CLI (nmcli) to access details about your network. Run the following command:
```
$ nmcli device show
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash

```

This command outputs information about the various network interfaces accessible on your Comet. Check the GENERAL.TYPE row to see which kind of network interface each block describes. For example, "ethernet" is the Ethernet port on your device, and "wifi" refers to the Wi-Fi chip built into some devices. You’ll look at different blocks of output to find your IP address depending on the way your device accesses the internet:

if your device connects to the internet using Wi-Fi, check the "wifi" block

if your device connects to the internet using the Ethernet port, check the "ethernet" block

Once you’ve identified the correct network interface block, look for a field named IP4.ADDRESS[1] for an IPv4 address or IP6.ADDRESS[1] for an IPv6 address. You can ignore the trailing slash and number (e.g. /24) in those fields.

In the example above, the Comet uses Wi-Fi to access the internet. Check the block where the GENERAL.TYPE field reads "wifi" to find the IP address. In this case, you can access this device using the IPv4 address in the IP4.ADDRESS[1] field: 192.168.29.96.

## Resolve mecha-comet.local with mDNS

If your device supports mDNS, you can reach your Mecha Comet by using its hostname and the .local suffix. The default hostname on a fresh OS install is mecha-comet, so by default any Mecha Comet running Machanix OS responds to:

```
ping mecha-comet.local
```

If the Mecha Comet is reachable, ping will show its IP address:
```
PING mecha-comet.local (192.168.29.96): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.29.96: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=2.618 ms
```

:::tip

If you change the system hostname of your Mecha Comet by editing /etc/hostname, mDNS updates the .local mDNS address. If you don’t remember the hostname of your Mecha Comet, you can install Avahi on another device, then use avahi-browse to browse all the hosts and services on your local network.

## Find devices with a smartphone app

The Fing app is a free network scanner for smartphones. It is available for Android and iOS.

Connect your phone to the same network as your Mecha Comet.

When you open the Fing app, touch the refresh button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

After a few seconds, you should see a list with all the devices connected to your network.

Scroll down to the entry with the manufacturer "Mecha Comet". The IP address appears in the bottom left corner, and the MAC address in the bottom right corner of the entry.
