# Introduction to remote access

Sometimes you need to access a Mecha Comet without connecting it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Perhaps the Mecha Comet is embedded in a robot or mounted in an inconvenient location. Or maybe you don’t have a spare monitor.

## Remote control over the local network

To remotely control your Mecha Comet from another device on your local network, use one of the following services:

* SSH

* VNC

SSH (Secure SHell) provides secure access to a terminal session on your Mecha Comet. VNC (Virtual Network Computing) provides secure access to a desktop screen share on your Mecha Comet. All you need is another computer, a local network, and the local IP address of your Mecha Comet.

## Share files between devices over the local network

Services like NFS (Network File System), SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), Samba, and rsync enable you to share files between devices on the local network without directly controlling the remote device. These services can be useful when you need to access data stored on one device from another device.

## Remote control over the Internet

To remotely control your Mecha Comet from any device connected to the Internet, you can:

Expose SSH or VNC on your Mecha Comet over the open internet, within a VPN, or using an external service like wayvnc’s VNC Viewer.
