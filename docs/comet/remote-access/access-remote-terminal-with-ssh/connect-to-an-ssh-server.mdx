# Access Remote Terminal with SSH
You can access the terminal of a Mecha Comet remotely from another computer on the same network using the Secure SHell (SSH) protocol.

## Connect to an SSH server

Open a terminal window on your computer and enter the following command, replacing the `<ip address>` placeholder with the IP address of the Mecha Comet youâ€™re trying to connect to and `<username>` with your username:

```bash
ssh <username>@<ip address>
```

When the connection works, you will see a security warning. Type yes to continue. You will only see this warning the first time you connect.

Enter your account password when prompted.

You should now see the Mecha Coment command prompt:

```bash
<username>@<hostname> ~ $
```

You are now connected to the Mecha Comet remotely, and can execute commands.

:::note
If you receive a connection timed out error, you may have entered the wrong IP address for the Mecha Comet. Check the IP address of the Mecha Comet.
