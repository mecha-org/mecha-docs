It is recommended to use a Public-Private Keypair to authenticate while connecting via SSH. This tutorial will help you set up Public Key Authentication for your Comet-M device.

## Generate a new Keypair

You can skip this step if you already have a keypair generated (for Github, or any other SSH connections).

* On your local machine, open a terminal and run the following command:

```
# MacOS / Linux
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# Windows
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

* You'll be prompted to enter the directory where you'd like to store the key pair. If you're happy with the default directory (`~/.ssh`), just press Enter.
* After choosing the key storage directory, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase. This is an extra layer of security, but it's optional. If you don't want to use a passphrase, you can leave it blank.

:::warning
Never share your private key. Keep it in a safe place.

## Copy the public Key to the device

* To copy your new (or existing) public key to the device, use the following command:

```
$ ssh-copy-id mecha@mecha-comet.local
```

* You'll be prompted to enter your password. Once that's done, your public key will be copied to the server.

## Test the Connection

* Try connecting to the device with the following command:

```
$ ssh mecha@mecha-comet.local
```

* If everything is set up correctly, you should be logged in without entering your password. That's it! ðŸŽ‰

## Disabling Password Authentication

Once you have successfully set up SSH key-based authentication, you can increase your device security by disabling password authentication. Here's how to do it:

1. Log into your server via SSH:

```
$ ssh mecha@mecha-comet.local
```

2. Open the SSH daemon configuration file using a text editor of your choice. We'll use nano for this example:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

3. Find the line that says `#PasswordAuthentication yes` and change it to `PasswordAuthentication no`. If the line doesn't exist, you can add it. Make sure to remove the '#' to uncomment the line.

4. Save and exit the file. In nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm saving the changes, and then `Enter` to confirm the file name.

5. Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

6. Exit the server and try logging in again with SSH. You should be able to log in with your SSH key, and the server won't accept password authentication:

```
$ ssh mecha@mecha-comet.local
```

That's it! You've successfully disabled password authentication for your SSH server. Remember, keep your private key safe and secure. ðŸŽ‰
