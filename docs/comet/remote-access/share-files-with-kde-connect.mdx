# Share files with KDE Connect
KDE Connect is a Linux app allowing to share things between your phone and a Linux desktop:

- Sharing copy/paste buffer;
- Pushing files directly to your PC;
- Showing SMS and other notifications on Linux desktop;
- Controlling music playing on Linux desktop from your phone (works with browser media if Plasma extension is installed: Firefox, Chrome)
- Showing who’s calling to you on your desktop, even if your phone lies God knows where in your apartment.

## Install KDE Connect

```bash
sudo apt install kdeconnect
```
Once the installation is complete, open the KDE Connect application on your Mecha Comet terminal with below command.

```bash
kdeconnect-app
```
Then, run KDE Connect on your Linux desktop and Android/IOS phone and pair them—you must have them both connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
