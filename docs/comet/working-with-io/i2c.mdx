## **Introduction to I2C**

The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave serial communication standard. It's designed for short-distance communication between integrated circuits, commonly used to interface microcontrollers with peripherals such as sensors, displays, and memory devices.

### I2C Protocol Fundamentals

- **Master-Slave Architecture:** Communication is initiated and controlled by a master device, with slave devices responding to requests.
- **Two-Wire Interface:** I2C utilizes two bidirectional lines:
  - **SCL (Serial Clock Line):** Synchronizes data transfer between devices.
  - **SDA (Serial Data Line):** Carries data between the master and slave devices.
- **Addressing:** Each slave device is assigned a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address, allowing the master to selectively communicate with specific devices.
- **Speed Modes:** I2C supports various speed modes, including Standard Mode (100 kHz), Fast Mode (400 kHz), and High-Speed Mode (3.4 MHz).

## I2C Implementation on Mecha Comet GPIO

The Mecha Comet device supports I2C communication through its GPIO pins, allowing seamless integration with various I2C-compatible peripherals. The following sections outline the pin configuration and how to access I2C on the Mecha Comet.


| Function     | GPIO Pin   |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| **I2C2_SCL** | GPIO5_IO16 |
| **I2C2_SDA** | GPIO5_IO17 |
| **I2C4_SCL** | GPIO5_IO20 |
| **I2C4_SDA** | GPIO5_IO21 |

### How I2C Works Over GPIO

I2C can be implemented in two ways:

1. **Hardware I2C:** Dedicated I2C hardware controllers within the Mecha Comet's processor manage the I2C protocol, offering optimal performance and reliability.
2. **Bit-Banged I2C:** Software-driven implementation of the I2C protocol using general-purpose GPIO pins. This method is less efficient and may be used in situations where hardware I2C resources are limited.

The Mecha Comet prioritizes hardware I2C for its superior performance and robustness.

## Accessing I2C on Debian-Based Systems

#### Checking Available I2C Buses

```bash
$ ls /dev/i2c-*
```

This will list available I2C buses, typically `/dev/i2c-1`, `/dev/i2c-2`, etc.

#### Enabling I2C

Ensure the I2C kernel module is loaded:

```bash
$ sudo modprobe i2c-dev
```

For persistent enabling, add it to `/etc/modules`:

```bash
echo "i2c-dev" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

#### Installing I2C Utilities

```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y i2c-tools
```

#### Detecting I2C Devices

```bash
$ sudo i2cdetect -y 2
```

This will scan I2C bus 2 for connected devices.

### **BMP180 Pin Configuration**

BMP180 is available in two modules. One is Five pin module and other is Four pin module. With Five pin module we have additional +3.3V pin which is absent in four pin module. Other than that the functioning is same.

| **Pin Name** | **Description**                                                          |

| GND          | Connected to ground.                                                     |
| SDA          | Serial Data pin (I2C interface)                                          |
| SCL          | Serial Clock pin (I2C interface)                                         |
| 3.3V         | If +5V is not present. Can power module by connecting +3.3V to this pin. |
