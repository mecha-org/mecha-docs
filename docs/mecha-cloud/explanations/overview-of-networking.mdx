### Introduction

This guide provides an overview of networking within the Mecha Console, focusing on how devices are interconnected within a network. It covers key concepts such as network diagrams, node connections, and the functionality available for managing networked devices.

### Network Components

#### Network

- **Name**: The network is identified by a unique name (e.g., `newnet`).
- **Network ID**: A unique identifier for the network (e.g., `0dc526d8c4fa-vnqj-212`).
- **Subnet**: Defines the IP address range used within the network (e.g., `172.16.36.0/24`).
- **DNS**: The Domain Name System (DNS) entry assigned to the network (e.g., `newnet.mec.sh`).
- **Encryption**: Specifies the encryption standard applied to secure the network, which in this case is managed by Mecha.

### Network Diagram

The network diagram visually represents the connections between devices (nodes) within a network. Each device, or node, is displayed with the following details:

- **Node Name**: The identifier or name of the device (e.g., `aquatic-valkyrie` and `grim-juggernaut`).
- **IP Address**: The unique IP address assigned to the device within the network (e.g., `172.16.36.107` and `172.16.36.222`).

#### Node Connections

The diagram may also show the relationships or connections between nodes:

- **Connection Lines**: Dashed lines between nodes indicate a connection or communication path within the network.

### Managing Network Nodes

Nodes represent the individual devices within a network. Each node is listed with detailed information and can be managed through the Mecha Console.

#### Viewing Node Details

In the "Network nodes" section, you can see each node's:

- **Name**: (e.g., `Grim Juggernaut` or `Aquatic Valkyrie`).
- **IP Address**: The node's assigned IP address (e.g., `172.16.36.222` or `172.16.36.107`).
- **DNS**: The DNS entry for the node (e.g., `grim-juggernaut.newnet.mec.sh`).
- **Creation Date**: The date when the node was added to the network (e.g., `20 Aug, 2024`).

#### Adding Nodes

To add new nodes to the network:

1. Click the "Update Network" button.
2. Enter the required details for the new node.
3. Save changes to add the node to the network.

#### Removing Nodes

To remove a node:

1. Locate the node in the "Network nodes" list.
2. Click the trash bin icon next to the node’s name.
3. Confirm deletion in the prompt to remove the node.

#### Searching Nodes

Use the search bar to find nodes by their DNS or IP address.

### Best Practices for Network Management

- **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the network diagram for any changes or issues.
- **Update Records**: Ensure all network node information is up-to-date.
- **Security Audits**: Periodically review the encryption and security settings for the network.
